# GridcoinSnapshotRestore
A tool to restore Gridcoin Snapshots in zip and 7zip formats

Simply load a zip or 7z snapshot file and press the "Restore Snapshot" button.

The software will delete the old blockchain files and extract the snapshot. If the wallet is running, it will close first, and when the process finish, it will open the wallet again.

# NOTE:
Beware of 3rd-party wallet backups. This tool is meant to be used as personal snapshot tool. If you are unsure if a snapshot is legitimate, please ask in the #gridcoin IRC channel in the Freenode server.
